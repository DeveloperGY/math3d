# Math 3D

Math3D is a library written in C++ with two interfaces, one for C and one for C++.  
This is so that it can be used in both C and C++ projects and take advantage of the features in each!  
  
Math3D is used to handles vectors, matrices, and quaternions for 3D graphics projects and can even integrate with opengl.
